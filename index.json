You wan\u0026rsquo;t to keep the skin anchored and tight so it becomes crisp. Use heat of the oven to soften the butter. Pop it in the fridge if it goes too far\nPut the veg in first to get a head start on them\nAfter the veg has had 10mins, put the chicken in and roast for about 10mins at 220degC then turn down to 180degC to cook for a further 40-45min. Longer if the skin needs more time to brown.\nBaste the chicken at the temp change at 10mins in, again at 25mins and a final time at 35mins in. This will get the skin nice and crispy. When basting for the last time at the 35min mark pop the rosemary in there as well to flavour the pan\nAfter time, take the chicken out of the pan and put on a plate, let the heat out of the oven and rest the chicken (and the veg) in the warm oven. Take the pan w/ drippings and make mums gravy. As the chicken rests it will release more juice which goes straight into the gravy pan.\nSeason the gravy with salt/pepper/honey/fresh lemon juice to balance. Consider cutting up some of the roasted rosemary in there to round it out (it\u0026rsquo;s a lemon \u0026amp; herb gravy) Enjoy Next time: Don\u0026rsquo;t let all the heat out of the oven while making the gravy dont risk the veg getting cold.\nMaybe cook everyting at 170degC (last time the chicken was a little dry but skin was good as we pushed it for 50min cook time) or let the chicken rest outside to collect juce and then back into the warm oven to rest\nWhen making the gravy skim off the butter and hold to the side. Add in the 2-3 teaspoons of flour and cook off on hob 4 [taking it on and off as you need] for ~5mins. You want to see the flour \u0026ldquo;bubble\u0026rdquo;.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll use about a whole milk jug of warm water to get this all together. It will thicken as it cools so maybe see if you can make it \u0026ldquo;thin\u0026rdquo; so as it does cool it doesn\u0026rsquo;t become a gel. Using less flour should help - testing 1.5 teaspoons of flour per person for gravy.\nAlso be carefull adding water to the pan after cooking the flour. Having it on hob 4 last time vapourised the water (maybe it wasn\u0026rsquo;t hot enough?) and caused some commotion. Taste as you go - add butter after you\u0026rsquo;ve cooked the flour and then added the water almost as a seasoning (mouthfeel rather than flavour?)\nTake photos to update the recipe\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Seasoned-Recipes/recipe/main/lemon--herb-roast-chook/","section":"Recipes","summary":"","title":"Lemon \u0026 Herb Roast Chook","type":"recipe"},{"content":"Lamb w/ mashed potato\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Seasoned-Recipes/recipe/main/mels-lamb-shanks/","section":"Recipes","summary":"","title":"Mels Lamb Shank Stew","type":"recipe"},{"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;ve cooked any meats like a roasted chicken or a leg of lamb, the drippings left over in the pan are flavours that are waiting to be unlocked.\nPut the pan on a low-medium heat and combine juices/water and flour lifting any baked on flavours with a wooden spoon.

The ingredient ammounts listed above makes enough of the filling for two. Also, a Pangritata is an easy addition to finish the dish if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a loaf on hand.\nMethod # Cut up pumpin into 3cm chunks, break down the onion and add half the sage. Coat in oil, salt, peper and nutmeg. Wrap up the garlic bulb in foil and drizzle with olive oil and salt. Place everything on a tray lined with baking paper and roast in the oven at 200degC for about 45 mins. ProTip: Turn the veg over after ~20min to get all sides caramalised. Remove the onion early if it\u0026rsquo;s done, don\u0026rsquo;t let it burn.\nWhile the pumpin is roasting make a batch of Fresh Pasta and leave to rest.\nOnce the veg is done, let it cool slightly before blending in a food processor. Add enough ricotta to smooth it out for a nice mouthfeel; peccorino for funk and if warranted some lemon zest for some brightness. Mix together and place in a \u0026ldquo;piping bag\u0026rdquo;.\nPortion and roll out the pasta dough passing 3 times on each thickness upto 4 and then one final pass on thickness 5. Try to make the pasta sheets wide when bookfolding so there\u0026rsquo;s less wastage when cutting out disks with the 7cm diameter cutter (3rd smallest).\nPipe the pumpkin mix into the centre of the pasta disks, wet around the edges and seal by pressing the edges together. Try to make the newly created double layers a little thinner so cooking the tortellini al dente is easier. Wrap the pasta around your little finger and wet one wing and press the other into it. Set aside.\nProTip: Use some folded up paper towel to wet the edges. It\u0026rsquo;s better than using a wet finger which you want to keep your hands dry while handling the pasta.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re ready put on a pot of salted water for the pasta and a saucepan on medium for the burned butter sauce. Once the butter is melted tear up a few sage leaves and add them in. Keep cooking the butter on a medium heat swishing it around to keep an eye on it so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t burn. Once the milk solids are golden add a few good squeezes of a lemon to stop the process, mix together and set aside. Cook the pasta, drain and then coat in the burned butter \u0026amp; sage sauce.\nTop with parmisan cheese and serve\nEnjoy with a glass of white wine Next time you make this:\nRemove Onion. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t blend well and chokes up the piping bag.\nSee how 1/2 a garlic goes. 1 head is proably too much.\nAdd some parmisan to the mix alongside the pecorino\nPay attention to the lemon zest.
