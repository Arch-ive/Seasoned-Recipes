Yes there\u0026rsquo;s alot of seasoning and tomatillos are hard to come by but get them in there, it tastes great.\nSkip to Method Steak + Marinade # Ingredient Amount Steak ~250g Scotch Fillet Chipotle Powder 1 tsp Dried Origano 11/2 tsp Onion Powder 1/4 tsp Pepper 1 tsp Salt 1 tsp Zest of an Orange 1/2 \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; 3/4 Olive Oil To combine Corn Salsa # Ingredient Amount Corn 1 cob Capcicum Yellow 1/2 \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; 3/4 Red Chili 1/2 Red Onion 1/4 Ginger 1 tsp Lime 1/2 Salt To taste Olive Oil A dash to bind Burnt Jalapeno \u0026amp; Tomatillo Avocado Cream # Ingredient Amount Avocado 1 Jalapeno 1/2 Tomatillo 2-3 Tomatillo Brine ~25ml Coriander Roots 3-4 Garlic 1 Clove Lime 1 Zest \u0026amp; Juice Salt \u0026amp; Pepper To taste Base Tortilla # Ingredient Soft Tortilla Tasty Cheese Red Cabbage Spinach Corriander Method # Turn on the BBQ on high and put the Jalapeno on.\nMix the steak marinade up and coat the steak. Leave it on its own dedicated plate as we\u0026rsquo;re going to toss the cooked cut steak in the remaining marinade.\nPrepare the corriander roots, peel and deseed the avocado, peel the garlic, get a few tomatillos + brine \u0026amp; zest and juice the lime all going into the large nutrabullet canister. Crack in some Salt and Pepper to taste. Leave aside for when the 1/2 burned Jalapeno once it\u0026rsquo;s cooled.\nStrip and put the corn on the BBQ along with the capcicum and turn down the BBQ to medium high heat; turn the veg occasionally. We want some char on these.\nFine dice the red onion and add salt, ginger, red chili, olive oil and the juice from the 1/2 lime. Set aside in a bowl for the corn and capcicum later.\nWhen the corn is about half way done. Put the steak on the BBQ turning once. Medium rare.\nTake everything off the BBQ turing it down to low (for the toasting the tortillas) and let the steak rest while you cut up the corn and capciccum for the salsa. Scrape the bitter black skin off the Jalapeno and deseed, adding it to the Avocado Cream ingridents and blitz all together. Taste it, add more lime/seasoning if needed.\nCut up the steak into thin slices and toss through the remaining marinade and toast tortillas on the BBQ lid down topped with tasty cheese.\nBuild your taco with some restraint \u0026amp; enjoy\nPro Tip: Save the Avocado cream as a dip. Make chips out of the leftover tortillas by baking them in the oven with olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika \u0026amp; cheese till they\u0026rsquo;re crisp.\n","date":"20 March 2023","permalink":"/Seasoned-Recipes/recipe/main/andys-steak-tacos/","section":"Recipes","summary":"This beef taco recipe is on point as it\u0026rsquo;s been adopted from a MasterChef challenge set by Winner and Judge Andy who loves is mexican food.","title":"Andy's Steak Tacos"},{"content":"These things make other things\n","date":"20 March 2023","permalink":"/Seasoned-Recipes/recipe/base/","section":"Recipes","summary":"These things make other things","title":"Base Recipes"},{"content":"Chicken, beetroot, cheese, spinach, mayo and some other ingredients? on a soft white roll\n","date":"20 March 2023","permalink":"/Seasoned-Recipes/recipe/main/bbq-chicken-rolls/","section":"Recipes","summary":"Chicken, beetroot, cheese, spinach, mayo and some other ingredients?","title":"BBQ Chicken Rolls"},{"content":"Buy BBQ\nBuy Lamb\nPut together\nhappy days\n","date":"20 March 2023","permalink":"/Seasoned-Recipes/recipe/main/bbq-lamb/","section":"Recipes","summary":"Buy BBQ","title":"BBQ Lamb"},{"content":"","date":"20 March 2023","permalink":"/Seasoned-Recipes/heros/beef/","section":"Heros","summary":"","title":"Beef"},{"content":"Beef \u0026amp; Beer\n","date":"20 March 2023","permalink":"/Seasoned-Recipes/recipe/main/beef-guinness-pie/","section":"Recipes","summary":"Beef \u0026amp; Beer","title":"Beef \u0026 Guinness Pie"},{"content":"Wrap up meat, veg and guac\n","date":"20 March 2023","permalink":"/Seasoned-Recipes/recipe/main/beef-burrito/","section":"Recipes","summary":"Wrap up meat, veg and guac","title":"Beef Burrito"},{"content":"Slow cooked beef\n","date":"20 March 2023","permalink":"/Seasoned-Recipes/recipe/main/beef-cheek-bourguignon/","section":"Recipes","summary":"Slow cooked beef","title":"Beef Cheek Bourguignon"},{"content":" Ingredients # Ingredient Amount Carrot 1kg Brown Onion 1 Ginger 1 thumb size Garlic 3 cloves Veg Stock 2 cups (500ml) Coconut Cream 1 tin (400ml) Salt To taste Olive Oil Dash Method # Add a dash of olive oil to a large pot and cook the onions for abit on a medium heat then add ginger and garlic and cook for another few mins while you cut up the carrots.\nAdd carrots and cook for a while.

The ingredient ammounts listed above makes enough of the filling for two. Also, a Pangritata is an easy addition to finish the dish if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a loaf on hand.\nMethod # Cut up pumpin into 3cm chunks, break down the onion and add half the sage. Coat in oil, salt, peper and nutmeg. Wrap up the garlic bulb in foil and drizzle with olive oil and salt. Place everything on a tray lined with baking paper and roast in the oven at 200degC for about 45 mins. ProTip: Turn the veg over after ~20min to get all sides caramalised. Remove the onion early if it\u0026rsquo;s done, don\u0026rsquo;t let it burn.\nWhile the pumpin is roasting make a batch of Fresh Pasta and leave to rest.\nOnce the veg is done, let it cool slightly before blending in a food processor. Add enough ricotta to smooth it out for a nice mouthfeel; peccorino for funk and if warranted some lemon zest for some brightness. Mix together and place in a \u0026ldquo;piping bag\u0026rdquo;.\nPortion and roll out the pasta dough passing 3 times on each thickness upto 4 and then one final pass on thickness 5. Try to make the pasta sheets wide when bookfolding so there\u0026rsquo;s less wastage when cutting out disks with the 7cm diameter cutter (3rd smallest).\nPipe the pumpkin mix into the centre of the pasta disks, wet around the edges and seal by pressing the edges together. Try to make the newly created double layers a little thinner so cooking the tortellini al dente is easier. Wrap the pasta around your little finger and wet one wing and press the other into it. Set aside.\nProTip: Use some folded up paper towel to wet the edges. It\u0026rsquo;s better than using a wet finger which you want to keep your hands dry while handling the pasta.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re ready put on a pot of salted water for the pasta and a saucepan on medium for the burned butter sauce. Once the butter is melted tear up a few sage leaves and add them in. Keep cooking the butter on a medium heat swishing it around to keep an eye on it so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t burn. Once the milk solids are golden add a few good squeezes of a lemon to stop the process, mix together and set aside.
