Score and salt the skin and rub fennel/herb paste on the underside. Let it sit in the fridge for the skin to dry out and the paste to penetrate the flesh

Roast it /w beetroot and other root veg

Serve with apple sauce

>Protip: when cutting the pork, place it skin side down and cut though the bottom down though to the skin

Next time you make this:<br>
- For the crackling, don't use the broiler. Turn the oven up to max first (apparently theres less moisture in the oven out the gate than turning it up as a finisher. t.Shannon Bennet)<br>
- 30min on max (turning halfway though) / 60min at 180degC with the veg / max again to "finish" [Note: last time the piece was ~2inch thick so thinner pieces will need less time right?]<br>
- Also more scoring and deeper. 2-3mm wide cuts lengthways ends up making the task of cutting up pieces while eating with a regular knife easier
