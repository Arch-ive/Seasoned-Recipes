Salt pork skin and rub fennel/herb paste on the underside. Let it sit in the fridge for the skin to dry out and the paste to penetrate the flesh

Roast it /w beetroot and other root veg

Serve with apple sauce


### Next time
- to get the skin to crackle, don't use the broiler. Turn the oven up to max.
- more scoring and deeper
