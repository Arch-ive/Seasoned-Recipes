## Method

Cut up the bacon into small pieces and fry them up in a deep pan. Remove them and set aside.

Put in the mince and brown it off. Drain most of the fatty water from the pan otherwise you'll have oil pockets when it's simmering.

Add the garlic, soup, tomato paste and herbs. Use water to get all the soup in the cans and dump it in and bring to the boil. Add the bacon.

<br>
Turn the heat down and simmer for around 30mins. Season with salt and pepper late in the cook. If you do it too early it'll cook down and be overpowering.
