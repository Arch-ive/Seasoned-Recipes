## Method

Cut up the bacon into small pieces and fry them up in a deep pan. Remove them and set aside.

Put in the mince and brown it off. If you wish remove the fat from the mince from the pan.

<br>
Turn the heat down and simmer for around 30mins. Season with salt and pepper late in the cook. If you do it too early it'll cook down and be overpowering.

>Pro Tip: You can always loosen this up with pasta water so don't be afraid to have a rich and thick sauce
