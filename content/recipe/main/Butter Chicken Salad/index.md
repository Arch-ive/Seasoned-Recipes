# Method

Drain the lentils and slowly heat though the whole spices in oil. Dice the onion and chili (deseeded) and add to the mix to cook.

Meanwhile prep the carrot by peeling it to strips and cutting the cucumber (seeds and all) in half then into odd bit size shapes for interest. Also shave the cabbage and add to a serving bowl. Dump the corriander in there too.

Take the roots and clean them and add them to the small nutribullet along with yoghurt, mango chutney, cashews, lemon juice and some salt and blend. Balance it as you go.

Add the lentils when the chicken in cooking. The lentils only need to be heated though. Add the sherry vinegar and taste. Salt or pepper or both depending.
