### Pull

Pull the beef and reduce the sauce for almost 1-1.5hrs (so stock pot gell pod may be worthwhile)

Add any cornstarch and slide the pulled beef back in there. Stir so it doesn't catch on the bottom the slowcooker as it is really hot on full sear. May want to pop it on hold to control the heat from getting to much.

Less Liquid or simmer uncovered (it takes almost an hour to reduce in the slow cooker & ~1/4cup of cornflour was added<br>
