Break this out on a weekend to set you up for the day. The bright pockets of acidity from the lemon in the avo and tang/sweetness of the tomatoes contrasts with the meatyness of the bacon & egg, garlic mushrooms and baked beans. Has the heart of a classic Full English with the soul of Australia.

- Heat a cast iron skillet and add a thin layer of butter to coat the pan. Cut the mushrooms into quaters and the tomato down (if it's a whole one) and add them to the pan. Microplane garlic over the mushrooms and add enough butter to them so they're coated and will absorb the flavour.

>perhaps make a garlic butter i.e. mix garlic and butter together before adding to the mushrooms

- Prepare the avocado while the mushrooms and tomatoes cook down. Scoop out the flesh of the avocado and use a fork to smash it up, season with salt and pepper and add a squeeze of lemon.

- Add bacon and cook for a while turning to coat it all in its own fat and once its looking almost there put the sourdough on the grill and add the spinich to the mushrooms.

- Baked beans go in and then crack the eggs in last. Let them cook for a few minutes. Salt and pepper on the eggs to finish.
