It's best to make this with [Fresh Pasta]({{< ref "recipe/base/fresh pasta" >}}) but packet will work.

## Method

### Preperation

- Cut one persons serve of fresh pasta dough ball and squash it flat so it can pass though the pasta roller. 

>Make sure to dust the pasta sheets during the rolling process if needed so it passes through easy and doesn't stick.

- Book-fold the dough 3 or 4 times and begin passing it though the roller 2-3 times on each setting finishing on thickness 4.

- Cut the pasta sheets to length for ease of eating and pass them through the spaghetti attachment

- Toss the spaghetti though flour to coat, separate and leave to dry for ~30mins

### Cook

- Boil a pot of water and preheat a pan to 2

- Salt the water and add the pasta. Add butter to the pan and turn up to 3 on the hob, when the butter is melted crack in pepper to temper (don't burn)

- Pull the pasta out when it's almost cooked and put it in the pan with the pepper and butter

- Add cheese and pasta water, simmer and toss until you get a good coating on the pasta. Add as much pepper frshly ground pepper as you wish.

- Serve

>Pro Tips: <br>
>Add enough pasta water where you've got a light pool in the pan; the aim is to have the pasta cooked through & enough water evaporated to finish the dish at the same time.

>Pre-heat the serving bowls so the sauce doesn't seize
