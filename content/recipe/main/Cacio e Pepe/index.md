It's best to make this with [Fresh Pasta]({{< ref "recipe/base/fresh pasta" >}}) but packet will work

## Method

### Preperation

- Cut one persons serve of fresh pasta from the dough ball and press it flat

>Make sure to dust the pasta sheets during the rolling process if needed so it passes through easy and doesn't stick

- Book-fold the dough passing it through the roller after each fold 3 or 4 times and then continue passing it 2-3 times on each setting, finishing on thickness 4

- Cut the pasta sheets to your desired length and pass them through the spaghetti attachment

- Toss the spaghetti though flour to coat, separate and leave to dry for ~30mins

### Cook

- Boil a pot of water and preheat a pan to 2

- Salt the water and add the pasta. Add butter to the pan and turn up to 3 on the hob, when the butter is melted crack in pepper to temper (don't burn)

- Pull the pasta out when it's almost cooked and put it in the pan with the pepper and butter

- Add cheese and pasta water tossing the until you get a good coating on the pasta. Add as much freshly ground pepper as you wish

- Serve

>Add enough pasta water where you've got a light pool in the pan; the aim is to use the residual heat of the pan to have the pasta cooked through & enough pasta water encorporate the cheese to finish the dish at the same time
>
>Pre-heat the serving bowls so the sauce doesn't seize up giving you more time to enjoy all you hard work

Draft:<br>
Last time the cheese clumped in the pan beause it was too hot. You need to keep the temperature between 63 - 74degC so the cheese melts but doesn't split<br><br>
You have manage the heat in the pasta, pasta water and pan.
- Take the pan off the heat once the butter has melted. <br>
- Decant the pasta water you want to use and let it stand for abit before you use it.<br>
- Let the pasta steam off in a collender before it goes in the pan
