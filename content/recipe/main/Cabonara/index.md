# Method

Dice up the onion and bacon. Add them & butter & a good few glugs of oil to a frypan and cook on low (3). Leave 2 eggs out to come to room temperature for later.

Boil water and cook the rigatoni separately in salty water. Cut up the parsley and ready the cheese to be mixed together with the eggs.

Once the pasta is on the verge of being cooked, drain the pot (catching the last of the pasta water in a mug) and add the bacon/onion pan to the pasta, crack in some pepper and mix. Then add the egg/cheese and parsley and mix, off and on the heat till done. Add some pasta water if it needs it.

> You don't want too much heat when the egg/cheese mix goes in otherwise it will scramble. Let pans/pots cool if need be.
