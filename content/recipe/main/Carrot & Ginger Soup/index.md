### Ingredients

| Ingredient  | Amount |
| ----- | ---- |
| Carrot | 1kg |
| Brown Onion | 1 |
| Ginger | 1 thumb size |
| Garlic | 3 cloves |
| Veg Stock | 2 cups (500ml) |
| Coconut Cream | 1 tin (400ml) |
| Salt | To taste |
| Olive Oil | Dash |


### Method

- Add a dash of olive oil to a large pot and cook the onions for abit on a medium heat then add ginger and garlic and cook for another few mins while you cut up the carrots.

- Add carrots and cook for a while. Let the water from the carrots steam off. You want to add the stock in when things begin to catch on the bottom of the pot to develop flavour.

- Add the stock and get the caught bits up. Cover the pot and bring to the boil and turn down to simmer for ~20min.

- Check to see if the carrots are cooked thru. If you can cut one in half on the side of the pot with a wooden spoon you're golden. Add the cocnut cream and blend.

- Serve with toast
