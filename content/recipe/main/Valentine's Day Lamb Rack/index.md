Buy a good quality rack of lamb.

Season with rosemary salt, pepper and olive oil.

Wrap the ribs in foil and sear the fillet. Put on a trivvet to roast. Finish with Lemon.

Sides: Lamb fat roast potato gems / mushy peas with mint / roast beetroot chutney

> When doing the potatoes, par boil them and shake the pot a few times to rough em' up. See if you can get any lamb fat drippings in there after the lamb is seared.<br>
> Season peas with salt and add a tiny bit of butter for luxury
