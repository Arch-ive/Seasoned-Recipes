2. Make a batch of [Fresh Pasta]({{< ref "recipe/base/fresh pasta" >}}) and leave to rest

3. After everything in the oven is done, let it cool for abit before you pop it all in a food processor and blend together. Add enough ricotta to smooth it out for a nice mouthfeel; some lemon zest (1/2 a lemon?) for some brightness and peccorino. Mix together and place in a piping bag.

4. Roll out the pasta passing 3 times upto 4 and then one final pass on thickness 5. Try to make the pasta sheets wide when bookfolding so there's less wastage when cutting out disks with the 3rd smallest cutter (7cm diameter).

5. Pipe the pumpkin mix into the centre of the pasta disks, wet around the edges with a paper towel, seal the pasta and press the edges trying to make the newly created double layers a little thinner so cooking times for aldente is good. Wrap the pasta around your little finger and wet one wing and press the other into it. Set aside.

>ProTip: Paper towel can be squeezed so its damp, way better than using a wet finger which you want to keep your hands dry for sealing

6. Put a pot of water on to boil; ready to put on the pasta when the burned butter sauce is ready. Add butter to a saucepan and heat. Halfway though tear up the rest of the sage. Keep cooking the butter on a medium heat swishing it around keeping an eye on it. Once the milk solids are caramlised, squeeze in juice of ~1/2 a lemon and bring it all together.
