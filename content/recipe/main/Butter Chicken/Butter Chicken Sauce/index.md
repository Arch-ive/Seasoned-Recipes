## Method

- First - start in the afternoon by soaking the cashews so they can be made into a paste later

- Saute the cardamom and mace in butter & oil in the large stainless steel pot for a few minutes

- Add the onion, tomato, galric, ginger and chili and cook on medium to break them down. Blend in the pot.

- Add the 120g of butter to the pot and season with salt. Add fenugreek and cashew paste. Cook for a further 15mins

- Add garam masala and honey and stir well to combine. Simmer for 15min and come back and taste to balance it (more honey/salt). Simmer for another 30mins

>Keep going back to taste. You don't want to put too much honey in there and upset the balance.

- Add cream and heat though for 3-5mins and you're ready
