## Method

### Toast & Grind - Whole Spices

Put your black peppercorns, corriander seeds and cumin seeds in a hot dry pan and toast for a few minutes. Put them directly into the mortar and pestle and grind into a powder and set aside.

### Cut & Pound - Wet Aromatics

Thinly cut the kaffir lime leaves discarding the woody stem and bash into the mortar and pestle. Cut the lemongrass as fine as you can into small disks discarding the tops and tails, breaking up the long fibres with a knife now will pay dividends in the long run. Bash them up as well. Then add the ginger (also cut against the grain) corriander root, garlic and salt.

Put away the mortar and pestle. We'll add these to the blender in due course.

Cut up the shallots, deseed and cut up the chilis (bar one half of one), pick the thai basil and roughly chop the shrimp paste. Put it all in the food processor and blend. Then add the previous spice and aromat mix and blend further, adding ~2 tablespoons of olive oil.
