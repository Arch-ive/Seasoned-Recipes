# Method

- Cut up the veg fairly chunky (we'll be roasting them for about an hour). Season with salt, pepper and olive oil. Toss together with the rosemary. Put the veg on their own roasting tray. Preheat the oven to 220degC

- Make a compound butter with tyme and lemon zest

- Gently separate the skin from the chicken get the compound butter under the skin. Massage the butter though the skin to get an even distribution, get a bit of butter on the outside of the skin aswell. Salt the chicken skin and then place the merrylands in a cast iron pan along with the 1/2 lemon face side down.

> Use heat of the oven to soften the butter. Pop it in the fridge if it goes too far

- Put the veg in first to get a head start on them

- After the veg has had 10mins, put the chicken in and roast for about 10mins at 220degC then turn down to 180degC to cook for a further 40-45min. Longer if the skin needs more time to brown.

> Baste the chicken at the temp change at 10mins and again at 25mins and a final time at 35mins in. This will get the skin nice and crispy.

- After time, take the chicken out of the pan and put on a plate, let the heat out of the oven and rest the chicken (and the veg) in the warm oven.

- Add flour to the pan drippings and water and cook (on low/med heat) to make [mums gravy]({{< ref "recipe/side/Mums Gravy" >}}).

> As the chicken rests it will release more juice which goes straight into the gravy pan. 

- Season the gravy with salt/pepper/honey to balance and also break up some of the roasted rosemary in there to round it out (it's a lemon & herb gravy)

Next time:<br>
- 2 large potatoes felt like too much, get one large one small one. Used dirty potatoes - try a different one next time. Up the carrots from 2 to 3.
- Separated most of the drippings to start off the 1tbsp of flour. Still had to add more in as I went. Next time add enough flour into all the drippings so all (or atleast most?) of the juices are absorbed (there was butter loose in the pan not combining with the gravy). Cook off the flour and keep adding water (quite a bit) to smooth it out.
