## Method

- Make a veg+mince+cheese bolognese

- Cut the zucchini in half and scoop out the seeds

- Pop the zucchini in a baking tray and fill them with the bolognese and top with cheese. Keep them snug.

- Bake in the oven until cheese is golden.

>Bake at 200 for 5-10min? and switch to grill. We want the zucchini to still have some bite. Don't overcook them.

- Make a herb salad of mint, basil and parsley dressed with olive oil and lemon juice for a side 

- Steam some frozen peas as well to round the meal out (add a small ammout of butter to them)
