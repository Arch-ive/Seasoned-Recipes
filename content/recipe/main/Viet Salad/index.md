Steep the noodles in boiling water and leave for a few minutes to come back to life. Drain them well and cut them up into the bowl with the rest of the preparied ingredients and mix to combine.

For the dressing - Juice a lime into a small mixing jug and add about an equal ammount of fish sauce making sure you're getting both sour and savoury. Microplane the garlic and add the diced chili and mini whisk. Top up with as much mayple syrup as nessecary to balance it out.

>Don't be afraid to put in alot of mayple

Serve with spinach in the bottom of the bowl and heap the salad on and dress. Add as many peanuts as you please.
