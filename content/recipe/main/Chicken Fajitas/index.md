# Method

Make the marinade by squeezing the juice of an orange, zest of a lime and half it's juice (other half goes in the adobo), garlic (microplaned) and spices. 

Prep the veg by cutting up the capcicum into strips and the red onion into petals (cut the half into 4 and peel).  Into the marinade.

Add olive oil to the pan and heat to a medium heat, cook the capcicum/onion for ~5mins to soften them up. Meanwhile  cut up the chicken into strips and put them in the marinade.

Add the chicken to the pan. Once the chicken is more cooked than not, add the rest of the marinade to the pan and simmer. Thicken by adding cornflour slurry.

Otherwise prep the other ingerdients ready to make a tortilla.
