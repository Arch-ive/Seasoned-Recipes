Grate the carrots. Chop garlic. Wash corriander roots(and stem) and finely dice. Chop celery. Chop onion. 
Toast the almonds and set aside. 
Spice the chicken and salt. Put skin side down in pan and let fat render. Set the chicken aside once golden brown. 
Add the chopped things into the pan with the chicken fat and add the ginger. Stir and sweat off for ~10mins.
Chop up the sultanas and add them along with the saffron, more spices (cardamom cumin), salt, 2-3 Bay leaves, 1 cup basmati rice, 1 cup chicken stock?
Mix and put the chicken back in and cover and let cook slowly (hob 1)
Cut up a handful of corriander leaves and put aside with the toast almonds (we add them at the end)
Add frozen peas at the end as well.
Debone the thighs and put back in the pan to crisp up the skin and cut them up to serve.
