This beef taco recipe is on point as it's been adopted from a [MasterChef](https://10play.com.au/junior-masterchef-australia/recipes/chipotle-scotch-fillet-tacos-burnt-jalapeno-and-avocado-cream-roasted-corn-salsa/r200911vkufy) challenge set by Winner and Judge Andy who loves is mexican food. Yes there's alot of seasoning and tomatillos are hard to come by but get them in there, it tastes great.

## Method

Turn on the BBQ on high and put the Jalapeno on.

Mix the steak marinade up and coat the steak. Leave it on its own dedicated plate as we're going to toss the cooked cut steak in the remaining marinade.

Prepare the corriander roots, peel and deseed the avocado, peel the garlic, get a few tomatillos + brine & zest and juice the lime all going into the large nutrabullet canister. Crack in some Salt and Pepper to taste. Leave aside for when the 1/2 burned Jalapeno once it's cooled.

Strip and put the corn on the BBQ along with the capcicum and turn down the BBQ to medium high heat; turn the veg occasionally. We want some char on these.

Fine dice the red onion and add salt, ginger, red chili, olive oil and the juice from the 1/2 lime. Set aside in a bowl for the corn and capcicum later.

When the corn is about half way done. Put the steak on the BBQ turning once. Medium rare.

Take everything off the BBQ turing it down to low (for the toasting the tortillas) and let the steak rest while you cut up the corn and capciccum for the salsa. Scrape the bitter black skin off the Jalapeno and deseed, adding it to the Avocado Cream ingridents and blitz all together. Taste it, add more lime/seasoning if needed.

Cut up the steak into thin slices and toss through the remaining marinade and toast tortillas on the BBQ lid down topped with tasty cheese.

Build your taco with some restraint & enjoy

> Pro Tip: Save the Avocado cream as a dip. Make [chips](chips.jpg) out of the leftover tortillas by baking them in the oven with olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika & cheese till they're crisp.
