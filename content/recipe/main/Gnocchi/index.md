## Method

- 1 potato per person and one for the pot

- Peel and cut potatoes to a size of they cook through evenly and reasonably quickly (1-2cm thick pieces)

- Boil potatoes until they're cooked (if you can squish one on the side of the pot they're done)

- Drain and then let them sit to steam (less moisture the better) and then pass them though the potato ricer. If they're still steamy let them sit.

- Season the riced potatoes with salt and dust with flour and fold and squish. Keep going until its not sticky to the touch.

>Be careful not to overwork the dough

- Roll it into a log and cut it into managable handful size section

- Roll those sections into long logs on a floured surface and cut into bite size pieces with a butter knife, flouring the ends and set a side.

- Boil a pot of water and pop the gnocchi in. When they float they're cooked.

- Add sauce, parm and parsley and enjoy.
