| Ingredient |  |
| ----- | ----- |
| Leek | 1-2 |
| Garlic | 2 cloves |
| Thyme | 2 sprigs |
| Spinach | 2 handfuls |
| Thick Cream | 1 cup |
| White Wine | Decent glug |
| Olive Oil | 2 tbsp |
| Butter | 2 tbsp |
| Salt | to taste |
| Pepper | to taste |
| Pappardelle | for 2 |
| Parmesan | to finish |

## Method

- Cut the roots and dark green off the leeks. Cut them into quaters lengthways and dice along with the garlic

> Make sure the leeks are washed well before you dice them up otherwise you'll have a gritty sauce

- Saute leeks, garlic and thyme in butter, oil and a pinch of salt on a low to med heat. Keep stirring until the leeks are translucent (~10min)

- Pour in the wine and simmer for ~2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add cream, simmer for ~15 minutes with a lid on until leeks are very tender and cream has thickened slightly

- Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta. Fold in the spinach when you drop the pasta into the water

- Transfer pasta to leeks in the pan and toss to coat. Add in butter and season to taste with salt and pepper. Finish with parmesan cheese on top and serve

> Bulk it up with peas or mushrooms or add/substitute another herb (parsley, oregano, etc) to mix it up
