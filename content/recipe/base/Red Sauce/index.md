| Ingredient  | Amount |
| ----- | ---- |
| Crushed Tomatos | 1 Can (400ml) |
| Garlic | 1-2 cloves |
| Olive Oil | 3-4 glugs |
| Parsley or Basil | 1 Handful |
| Cheese | 2 tablespoons |
| Butter | Tiny knob |

## Method

- Get the deep dish pan on a medium heat and add the olive oil, garlic and any herb stems (finely diced).

> You want the heat to extract the flavour of the garlic into the oil so it goes thoughout the dish so avoid burning it. Adding herb stems at the start helps break them down.

- After ~10mins add the tomato and soft herbs. Turn down the heat and simmer for a further ~10-15min.

- To finish add a tiny knob of butter, cheese and a splash of pasta water and mix through.

- Add pasta to the pan to coat and serve up.
