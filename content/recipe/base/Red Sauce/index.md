| Ingredient  | Amount |
| ----- | ---- |
| Crushed Tomatos | 1 Can (400ml) |
| Onion | 1/2 |
| Garlic | 1-2 cloves |
| Olive Oil | 3-4 glugs |
| Parsley or Basil | 1 Handful |
| Cheese | 2 tablespoons |
| Butter | Tiny knob |

## Method

- Get the deep dish pan on a medium heat and add the olive oil, onion (diced) and eventually garlic and sweat them down.

> You want the heat to get the flavour into the oil so it goes thoughout the dish but avoid burning anything. Add any herb stems at the start to help break them down.

- After the onion has gone soft and translucent add the tomato and herbs. Turn down the heat and simmer for ~10-15min.

- To finish add a tiny knob of butter, cheese and a splash of pasta water and mix through.

- Add pasta to the pan to coat and serve up.
