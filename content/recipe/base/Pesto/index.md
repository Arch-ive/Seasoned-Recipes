### Pesto

| Ingredient |
| ----- |
| Basil |
| Parmisan Cheese |
| Pine Nuts |
| Olive Oil |
| Lemon |

When you come across large bunches of basil that are looking really fresh, pick them up to make up some pesto.

Pick the leaves, wash and dry them and put them in a blender.

> Drying the basil with paper towls and a tea towel works. Don't be afraid to bruise them, they're getting blended anyway.

Toast the pine nuts in a frying pan. Make sure you cool them down before using them.

Generally you want to add half as much pines nuts as you do cheese. Olive oil as you need to loosen it up.

Keep blending and add more cheese/nuts/oil as you feel is necessary.

When you're happy, squeeze in some lemon juice and blend again to mix through.

> The lemon juice brightens and retains the colour.

Serve immedately or freeze for later.
