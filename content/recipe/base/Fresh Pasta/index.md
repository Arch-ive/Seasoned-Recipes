### Method

Add salt into a mixing bowl and then the flour. Make a well in the centre; crack in the egg(s) and add an ammount of water. Mix to bring it together.

Turn the mixture out onto the bench and kneed to combine adding more flour as you go so it doesn't stick to the bench or more water if it's not smooth enough. Continue to kneed for 5mins to get same consistancy thoughout making long strokes with your palm to develop the gluten.

Form the dough into a ball, it should be smooth and spring back when you poke it. Dust with flour and wrap in glad wrap to rest for ~30mins.

You're ready to roll it out and create your desired shape.
