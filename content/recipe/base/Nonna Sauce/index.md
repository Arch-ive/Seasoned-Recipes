| Ingredient | Amount |
| ----- | ----- |
| Passata | 700g |
| Brown Onion |  1 |
| Celery |  3-4 sticks |
| Bay Leaf | 1 |
| Parsley | 1 bunch |
| Water | ~500ml |
| Salt | to taste |
| Pepper | to taste |
| Brown Sugar | to balance |

### Method

- Finely chop the celery and brown onion and put them into a saucepan
- Add salt and a few glugs of olive oil to coat everything and put the pan on a low heat (3) [give it max to kickstart but turn back to 3 after a minute or two]
- Meanwhile get your parsley and separate the stems from the leaves. Finely chop the parsley stalks and add them to the pan also. Set aside the leaves for later
- After about 10-15min add the pasata, bay leaf and wash out the passata bottle with water and dump it in the pan. Add enough water to loosen up the mix. Stir through and heat up to a simmer then put back to hob 2 and rest a lid on the top to leave a small gap to vent some steam
- Let it tick over for 25-35min. Pop the lid off if you think its too loose or more water if too thick
- Once its had its time check for seasoning. Add some pepper and more salt in needed. Also a pinch of brown sugar to balance against the acidity of the tomatoes
- Take the sauce off the heat and remove bay leaf. Chop the parsley leaves and add them to the sauce.
- The sauce is ready to go
