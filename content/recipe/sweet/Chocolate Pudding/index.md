| Ingredient | Amount |
| :---------- | :-------: |
| Cocoa Powder | 60g |
| Brown sugar | 250g |
| Water (boiling) | 500ml |


## Method

Mix the dry ingredients together. Add the eggs, butter (melted), salt, vanilla, milk and mix until combined as a thick batter.

Put the batter into a baking dish and then top with extra cocoa powder, brown sugar and then gently pour over the boiling water.

Bake in the over at ~175degC for ~10-20mins? It shouldn't be like lava cake (uncooked batter) but also not cooked too long where there's no "sauce". Feel it out.

Serve with Vanilla Ice Cream
