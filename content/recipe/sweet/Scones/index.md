| Ingredient  | Amount |
| ----- | ---- |
| Self Rasing Flour | 2 Cups |
| Butter | 40g melted |
| Milk | ~1 Cup |
| Salt | pinch to taste |

## Method

Melt the butter gently and warm the milk. 
<br><br>
Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and use a spoon to slice though the ingredients, scraping and lifting any dry ingredients from the bottom of the bowl to roughly mix it together. 
<br><br>
Dust the bench with flour. Turn the mix out onto the bench and bring it all together with your hands and pat it out to ~2cm thick. While cuting out the scones, dust the ring with flour between cuts so goes though clean and doesn't catch (the dough should be a little wet and sticky).
<br><br>
Place the cut dough together on a baking paper in an arragement so they support each other as they rise, brush with milk and bake in the oven at 200degC for about 10mins or until golden. 

>Break one off and tap it on the base with your finger. If it makes a hollow noise it's risen and cooked though; if it's still doughy it'll make a dull sound and you'll need to cook them a little longer.

Once they're done, take them out of the oven and wrap them in a tea towel to cool. While they're cooling whip some cream and find your favourite [jam]({{< ref "recipe/sweet/jam" >}}).

Reminder:<br>
The Original recipe was 3 cups / 60g butter / 1.3-1.5 milk. The ammounts have been reduced for 2. In theory the recipe calls for 3/4 of a cup of milk but a full 1 cup worked last time.<br>
Do not "work" the dough like it's pasta. If you do the scones will turn out rock hard.
