| Ingredient  | Amount |
| ----- | ---- |
| Self Rasing Flour | 2 Cups |
| Butter | 40g melted |
| Milk | ~1 Cup |
| Salt | pinch to taste |

## Method

Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and turn out onto the bench. Bring it all together, roll flat and cut out. Place the cut dough together on a baking paper, brush with milk and bake in the oven at 200degC for about 10mins or until golden.

Once they're done, take them out of the oven and wrap them in a tea towel to cool. While they're cooling whip some cream and find your favourite [jam]({{< ref "recipe/sweet/jam" >}}).

Reminder:<br>
The Original recipe was 3 cups / 60g butter / 1.3-1.5 milk. The ammounts have been reduced for 2.<br>
Do not "work" the dough like it's pasta. If you do the scones will turn out rock hard.
