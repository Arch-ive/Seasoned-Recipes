# Blueberry/Strawberry/Blackberry Jam

Half/Half sugar and fruit. If you want smoother less chunky jam cook the fruit down without the sugar first (sugar stops the structure from breaking down).

Bloom the gelatine in cold water and add it to the mix when it's off the heat.

Juice of one citruis per 250mls to finish. Orange for blueberry. Lemon for Strawberry.
