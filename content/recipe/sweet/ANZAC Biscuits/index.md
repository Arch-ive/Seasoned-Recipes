| Ingredient | Amount |
| :---------- | :-------: |
| Oats | 1 cup |
| Plain Flour | 1 cup |
| Desiccated coconut | 1 cup |
| Brown Sugar | 1 cup |
| Butter | 125g |
| Golden Syrup | 1 tbsp |
| Hoy water | 1 tbsp |
| Bicarb soda | 1 tsp |

Preheat oven 175degC
Combine oats, flour, coconut and brown sugar in a bowl. 
Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the golden syrup. Mix and bring it to the boil. Once it's bubbling, take it off the heat.
Mix the hot water and bicarb soda and add it to the butter and syrup – it should froth up. Pour this into the dry ingredients and stir together. If the mixture is a little dry add some more water. 
Portion the mix and roll them into balls and place them on a greased baking tray about 5cm apart. Squish them slightly and put them in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until they’re golden brown.
Let them rest in the tray for about a minute and then move them to a wire rack to cool completely.
