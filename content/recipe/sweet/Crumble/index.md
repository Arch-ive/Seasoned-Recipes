## Method

Peel the green apples, core them and cut them down into ~8ths. Grab whatever berries your have (Blackberry/Blueberry/Raseberry/Strawberry) or even Rhubarb.

Dust the mix in a bowl with flour, sugar & cinnamon. Juice ~1/2 a lemon over them, mix and place in a baking dish.

To make the "crumble" topping put the oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, baking powder and (softened) butter into a bowl and combine roughly and spread over the fruit. Don't skimp on the ammount, it's called crumble for a reason.

Bake for 30-40min s in a 180degC oven or until the crumble is golden brown and the mix is blipping up. Let it cool for 10mins or so.

Serve with Vanilla Ice Cream.
