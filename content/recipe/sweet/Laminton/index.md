Considerations for the recipe:<br>
- Is there a need to soak the sponge in something like a sugar syrup to make it extra moist?
- Different flavoured syrups can significantly change the experience e.g. orange syrup for a jaffa lammington
- Can the sponge naturally take on these flavours and stay moist when cooked right?
