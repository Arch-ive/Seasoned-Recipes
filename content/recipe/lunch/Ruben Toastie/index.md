Ok so it's not roast beef but it's a top tier toastie

| Ingredient  | Amount |
| ----- | ---- |
| Bread | Light Rye |
| Ham | 1<sup>1/2</sup> Slices |
| Tasty Cheese | 1-2 Slice(s) |
| Sauerkraut |  |
| Mayo |  |
| Mustard |  |
| Parmasan Cheese | For the outside |
| Butter | Spread on the outside |

## Method

Get all your ingredients ready to go. Start by buttering a slice of bread and pressing the cheese into it. Put it into the pan and turn it on (hob4).<br>

Spread on the mustard, add cheese, ham, sauerkraut, mayo and top with bread - butter and cheese it in the pan and squash it.

Flip it when ready to crisp up the other side. Can lower the heat to hob 3 and flip it a few more times to heat it all though.

>Take the ingredients out of the fridge to come to room temp so the cheese melts fully
