Ok so it's not roast beef but it's a top tier toastie

| Ingredient  | Amount |
| ----- | ---- |
| Bread | Light Rye |
| Ham | 1<sup>1/2</sup> Slices |
| Tasty Cheese | 1-2 Slice(s) |
| Sauerkraut |  |
| Mayo |  |
| Mustard |  |
| Parmasan Cheese | For the outside |
| Butter | Spread on the outside |

## Method

Put together and toast it in the pan. Making the parm/butter crisp really elevates this toastie.
