| Bread |
| Olive Oil |
| Salt |

Break down some bread and slash it in the pan with olive oil (if you've got confit garlic, heat it up in the oil first to flavour it). Toss and cook till crisp, season with salt and turn out onto some paper towel to drain any excess oil. 

Use to finish on dishes that need some more texture or crunch.
