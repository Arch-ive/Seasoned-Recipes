## Ham baked in a cherry glaze

Preheat oven to 200degC

Combine cider, sugar and cherry jam in a saucepan; bring to the boil. Simmer rapidly for 10-15 minutes or until the glaze is syrupy; remove from heat and stir in mustard. Allow to cool.

Meanwhile, run thumb under rind to separate from fat. Peel back, sliding fingers under rind to remove while keeping the fat in place.

Using a sharp knife, score the fat diagonally at 3cm intervals to form a diamond pattern. Be careful not to score the fat too deeply or it may slide off during cooking and give an uneven finish.

>When scoring the fat, don't go all the way down to the meat else it shrinks and separates exposing the meat below. Score gently and stud. It's difficult but just be careful about it, it's not the end of the world if after it's baked some of the fat has pulled away.

Push one whole clove into the centre of each diamond. The cloves help hold the fat layer in place. Bake, basting twice with the cherry mixture for 20-30 minutes, until caramelised.

Serve with bay leaves, rosemary and fresh cherries
