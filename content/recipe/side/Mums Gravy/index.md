If you've cooked any meats like a roasted chicken or a leg of lamb, the drippings left over in the pan are flavours that are waiting to be unlocked.

Put the pan on a low-medium heat and combine juices/water and flour lifting any baked on flavours with a wooden spoon. Keep stiring and add more flour/liquid to get the right consistancy.

It's a simple method but the results can't be argued with.

Next time you make this:<br>
Capture most of the juices in a cup and add a "base" ammount of flour so it balls up (flour should not be white)<br>
Move the flour ball around pressing and streaking it into the pan with the back of the spoon to cook out the raw flour<br>
Once the flour has been cooked out add the juices collected back into the pan and stir<br>
Add any drippings from any rested meat as well to further flavour the gravy
