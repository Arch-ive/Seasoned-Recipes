If you've cooked any meats like a roasted chicken or a leg of lamb, the drippings left over in the pan are flavours that are waiting to be unlocked.

Put the pan on a low-medium heat and add water and flour lifting any baked on flavours with a wooden spoon. Keep stiring and add more flour/water to get the right consistancy.

It's a simple method but the results can't be argued with.
